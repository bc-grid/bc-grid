## How to use this document

When the maintainer says **"review your handoff"**, read the **Active task** section below and proceed. This document is the source of truth for what worker3 should be doing right now. The Claude coordinator in `~/work/bc-grid` keeps it current.

## Active task — Audit lane (assigned 2026-05-02)

**Read and execute:** `docs/coordination/audit-2026-05/brief-worker3.md`

This is a **read-only audit** — no source changes. You will produce one findings document.

**Output branch:** `agent/worker3/audit-2026-05`
**Output file:** `docs/coordination/audit-2026-05/worker3-findings.md`
**PR title suggestion:** `audit: worker3 editors + keyboard/a11y + lookup findings (2026-05)`

When the PR is open, comment on it tagging the coordinator and stop. Do not start another task until this handoff is updated.

## Standing lane scope

Editor validation, keyboard/a11y contracts, and lookup/select/autocomplete UX. Specifically:

- `packages/editors/`
- Editor keyboard contract: F2, printable seed, Enter, Shift+Enter, Tab, Shift+Tab, Escape, click-outside
- Validation surface (portal-level messages, pending/error/disabled/focus visual state)
- Lookup/select/autocomplete: typed values, async option behavior, color-swatch capability

You do **NOT** own: server row model, filters, aggregations, theming. Don't refactor adjacent code.

## Worker rules (recap — full rules in `docs/AGENTS.md`)

- Branch off `main`. Never commit to `main`.
- Branch name: `agent/worker3/<task-slug>`.
- Run `bun run type-check`, `bun run lint`, focused unit tests.
- Do **NOT** run Playwright, smoke-perf, perf, or broad benchmarks. Coordinator owns those.
- Open PR against `main`. Do not merge your own PR.
- Update `docs/queue.md` at state transitions.

## Recent activity baseline

- v0.3.0 shipped (88398c6).
- Recent editor work on main: lookup editor recipes (#346), lookup editor contracts (#340), range paste helper planning (#331), TSV parse diagnostics (#339).
- v0.4 chrome polish from #349 is the current visible UI baseline.

## When you finish the active task

1. Push the findings doc as a PR (single doc, no source changes).
2. Comment on the PR tagging the coordinator.
3. Wait for the next handoff update before starting new work.
