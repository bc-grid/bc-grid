## Active task — v0.5: `useServerPagedGrid` turnkey hook (updated 2026-05-02 — re-ping)

### What's already shipped from your lane

- ✅ **#353** `rowProcessingMode` — went out in `v0.4.0`
- ✅ **#360** worker1 audit findings doc
- ✅ **#363** `useServerPagedGrid` turnkey orchestration hook (audit P0-6)
- ✅ **#366** `apiRef.scrollToCell` + `useServerPagedGrid.scrollToServerCell` action (audit P0-7 server-side)
- ✅ **#368** `useServerInfiniteGrid` + extracted `internal/useServerOrchestration.ts`
- ✅ **#371** `useServerTreeGrid` companion hook — closes the server-hook trio (paged + infinite + tree)

### Active now → `v05-use-server-tree-grid-enhancements`

Bsncraft v0.4 audit (2026-05-03) reviewed `useServerTreeGrid` (your #371) for a real consumer scenario: full-dataset grouping on a 36k-row customers grid. The hook ships, but bsncraft consumes plain `<BcGrid>` with their own paged loader (`apps/web/components/server-edit-grid.tsx`) — using `useServerTreeGrid` as-is forces a `<BcGrid>` → `<BcServerGrid>` swap on a production grid mid-sprint. That's exactly the migration friction the audit flagged. **Pivoting from the stretch generic-`TRow` task** because this enhancement has an actual unblocked consumer and the stretch is a type-tightening with diminishing returns.

**Spec:**

1. **Dual-output refactor (PRIORITY).**
   ```ts
   const { bound, serverProps, state, actions } = useServerTreeGrid({ ... })

   // Plain <BcGrid> consumer (bsncraft pattern):
   <BcGrid {...bound} columns={columns} />

   // <BcServerGrid> consumer (still works):
   <BcServerGrid {...serverProps} columns={columns} />
   ```
   `bound` is `BcGridProps`-compatible: `data: TRow[]` (the visible flattened tree rows), `groupBy`, `expansion`, `onExpansionChange`, sort/filter/search controlled props, `pagination` etc. The hook internally still drives the same `LoadServerTreeChildren` orchestration — it just exposes the unwrapped surface.

2. **`groupRowId?: (key, path) => RowId` option (PRIORITY).** Stable group-row identifiers for selection algebra, focus retention, persisted expansion. Replace whatever the hook synthesises internally today with the consumer-supplied function when present.

3. **`persistTo?: "url" | "localStorage" | null` option (PRIORITY).** Match `useBcGridState`'s persistence pattern — URL or localStorage backing for `groupBy` / `expansion` / `sort` / `filter` / `search` state. Same `gridId` keying.

4. **Nice-to-have (defer if scope tightens):** `rootChildCount?` (saves a round-trip), `pageSize?` (default 100), `cacheLimit?` (LRU cap on expanded-group caches).

**Branch:** `agent/worker1/v05-use-server-tree-grid-enhancements`. **Effort:** ~1 day for items 1-3, +half day for 4 if scope permits.

**After this lands:** coordinator cuts `0.5.0-alpha.1` so bsncraft can pull from the registry. Then we pair on the bsncraft migration proof (your existing handoff item).

### Deferred → `v05-server-loader-generics` (stretch P1-C2)

Generic `TRow` propagation into `LoadServerPage<TRow>` / `LoadServerBlock<TRow>` / `LoadServerTreeChildren<TRow>` query types — defer to v0.6 unless you finish the enhancement above with time to spare. Type-tightening with no blocked consumer; lower priority than unblocking bsncraft's customers grid.

### After enhancement → bsncraft migration proof (coordinator-led)

The coordinator owns the bsncraft migration proof but server-grid expertise is yours. Pair on:
- Migrating `~/work/bsncraft/apps/web/components/server-edit-grid.tsx` (the 9-`useState` orchestration) to `useServerPagedGrid` for the ungrouped flat view, then `useServerTreeGrid` (with the new dual-output `bound`) for the full-dataset grouping view. Hook swap based on whether a group column is selected.
- Target diff: ≥-100 LOC of wrapper code.
- Walking through any rough edges that surface — every "this is awkward" moment in the migration is a v0.6 input.

### Earlier follow-up tasks superseded (server-hook trio complete)

Same orchestration shape as `useServerPagedGrid` and `useServerInfiniteGrid`, adapted for `LoadServerTreeChildren`. Reuses the `internal/useServerOrchestration.ts` primitives you extracted in #368. **Recommendation: branch from `agent/worker1/v05-use-server-infinite-grid`** (your #368 branch) so you get the orchestration extraction without waiting for #368 to merge — coordinator will sort the merge order.

**Spec:**
```ts
export function useServerTreeGrid<TRow>(opts: {
  gridId: string
  loadChildren: LoadServerTreeChildren<TRow>
  rowId: (row: TRow) => RowId
  initialExpansion?: ReadonlySet<RowId>
}): {
  props: BcServerGridProps<TRow>      // spread-ready, rowModel="tree"
  state: ServerTreeState<TRow>        // expansion map, loading set, error
  actions: { reload, expandRow, collapseRow, applyOptimisticEdit }
}
```

**The hook owns:**
- Lazy-children fetching when a row's expansion state flips
- Per-row request-id flow (children of row A don't cancel children of row B)
- Stale-response rejection per row
- Recursive optimistic edit / rollback (parent + descendants)
- AbortSignal threading

**Reference:** `useServerPagedGrid` + `useServerInfiniteGrid` are templates. The hook should compose `useServerOrchestration` (single-stream request management) or extend it for the per-row case if needed.

**Tests:** unit-level for expansion → lazy fetch flow, per-row request-id supersedure (expand row A, expand row B, collapse row A, fetch row B should still complete), optimistic edit on a deeply nested child.

**Branch:** `agent/worker1/v05-use-server-tree-grid`. **Effort:** ~half day.

### Follow-up tasks (after `useServerTreeGrid` PR is open)

1. **Stretch: Generic `TRow` propagation** into `LoadServerPage<TRow>` / `LoadServerBlock<TRow>` / `LoadServerTreeChildren<TRow>` query types so `query.sort` / `query.filter` are typed against column ids (audit P1-C2). Branch: `agent/worker1/v05-server-loader-generics`. Only ship if low risk; defer to v0.6 if it churns the public type surface.
2. **Help on bsncraft migration proof** — bsncraft's `ServerEditGrid` wrapper (`~/work/bsncraft/apps/web/components/server-edit-grid.tsx:74-163`) is the textbook customer for `useServerPagedGrid`. Coordinator owns the migration but you'd be the natural co-owner since you wrote the hook. Branch: `coordinator/bsncraft-migration-proof` (joint coordinator + worker1).
3. **Audit P1 server-perf items.** Your audit findings doc (#360) flagged a few server-perf items (cache eviction tuning, prefetch budget calibration). Convert anything that's still relevant against the now-shipped `useServerPagedGrid` / `useServerInfiniteGrid` into v0.6 tasks. Branch: `agent/worker1/v05-server-perf-audit-followups` (read-only audit-style PR; produce a follow-up tasks doc rather than implementation).

### Primary task — `useServerPagedGrid({ gridId, loadPage })`

Audit P0-6 / synthesis sprint plan. The single biggest API ergonomics win for the BusinessCraft ERP migration.

**Spec:**
```ts
export function useServerPagedGrid<TRow>(opts: {
  gridId: string
  loadPage: LoadServerPage<TRow>
  initial?: { sort?, filter?, search?, page?, pageSize? }
  debounceMs?: number  // default 200ms for filter/search
  rowId: (row: TRow) => RowId
}): {
  props: BcServerGridProps<TRow>      // spread-ready into <BcServerGrid>
  state: ServerPagedState<TRow>       // current sort/filter/page/loading
  actions: { reload, setPage, setPageSize, applyOptimisticEdit }
}
```

**The hook owns:**
- `requestId` flow (each loadPage call gets an incrementing id; only the latest result is applied)
- Stale-response rejection (responses for a superseded requestId drop silently)
- Debounce on filter/search changes (default 200ms; configurable via `debounceMs`)
- Page reset on filter / sort / search change (back to page 0)
- Optimistic edits in flight (consumer calls `actions.applyOptimisticEdit({ rowId, patch })`; hook tracks until next loadPage settles or rejects)
- Error surface (`state.error` carries last loadPage error; `actions.reload()` retries)
- AbortSignal threading (uses the existing `ServerLoadContext.signal`)

**Reference implementation:** `~/work/bsncraft/apps/web/components/server-edit-grid.tsx:74-163`. That's the 9-`useState` orchestration this hook subsumes. Read it first; the hook should make all of that disappear in the consumer.

**Tests:** unit-level for the orchestration (request-id supersedure, debounce timing, page reset semantics, optimistic edit lifecycle). Don't write Playwright — coordinator runs that.

**Branch:** `agent/worker1/v05-use-server-paged-grid`

### Follow-up tasks (after the hook PR is open)

1. **`apiRef.scrollToCell(rowId, colId, opts)`** for server-paged grids. Returns a Promise that resolves once the cell is loaded + visible (handles the "row not yet loaded" case via the hook's loadPage). Branch: `agent/worker1/v05-api-ref-scroll-to-cell`.
2. **Companion hooks** if scope permits: `useServerInfiniteGrid`, `useServerTreeGrid`. Defer to v0.6 if tight.
3. **Stretch: Generic `TRow` propagation** into `LoadServerPage<TRow>` query type so `query.sort` / `query.filter` are typed against column ids. Branch: `agent/worker1/v05-server-loader-generics`. Only ship if low risk.

### Coordinator answers / context

- **PR #353 status:** approved; coordinator merging this turn after baseline bump. You don't need to do anything for it. The `rowProcessingMode="manual"` you added is exactly what `useServerPagedGrid` will rely on internally — your prior PR set up the foundation for this hook.
- **Cross-worker contract for `apiRef`:** worker3 owns editor-side methods (`focusCell`, `startEdit`, `commitEdit`, `cancelEdit`, `getActiveCell`); you own server-side (`scrollToCell`); worker2 owns filter-side (`openFilter`, `closeFilter`). Coordinate via the public `BcGridApi` type — no shared internal state.

### Rules reminder

- Don't run Playwright / smoke-perf / perf / broad benchmarks.
- Open PR; do not merge your own.
- Update `docs/queue.md` `[draft]` → `[in-flight: worker1]` → `[review: worker1 #PR]` at state transitions.

## Standing lane scope

Server-backed grid stability and v0.4 server edit contracts. Specifically:

- `packages/server-row-model/`
- `packages/react/` server-grid bindings (server grid component, server row caching, optimistic edit flow)
- Perf posture (virtualizer steady-state under churn)

You do **NOT** own: editors, filters, aggregations, theming, chrome polish. Don't refactor adjacent code while you're here.

## Worker rules (recap — full rules in `docs/AGENTS.md`)

- Branch off `main`. Never commit to `main`.
- Branch name: `agent/worker1/<task-slug>`.
- Run `bun run type-check`, `bun run lint`, focused unit tests.
- Do **NOT** run Playwright, smoke-perf, perf, or broad benchmarks. Coordinator owns those.
- Open PR against `main`. Do not merge your own PR.
- Update `docs/queue.md` at state transitions.

## Recent activity baseline

- v0.3.0 shipped (88398c6).
- Server grid hardening already on main: PR #343 (paged edit contracts), PR #327 (flicker boundary), PR #344 (server row query contracts).
- v0.4 chrome polish from #349 is the current visible UI baseline.

## When you finish the active task

1. Push the findings doc as a PR (single doc, no source changes).
2. Comment on the PR tagging the coordinator.
3. Wait for the next handoff update before starting new work.
